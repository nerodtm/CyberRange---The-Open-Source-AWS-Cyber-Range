# Overview: 
This CyberRange project represents the first open-source Cyber Range blueprint in the world.

This project provides a bootstrap framework for a complete  offensive, defensive, reverse engineering, & security intelligence tooling in a private research lab using the AWS Cloud. 

This project contains vulnerable systems and a toolkit of the most powerful open-source / community edition tools known to Penetration testers.

It simply provides a researcher with a disposable offensive / defensive AWS-based environment in less than 5 minutes.

## Domains of knowledge
This open-source research lab provides a bootstrap learning platform for 
Technologists studying any one of the "Big-3" technology skills.  

1. Cyber Security
2. Cloud Computing
3. DevOps
 
This project supports 7 gigantically broad domains of technical knowledge.

1. Offensive Security
2. SecDevOps
3. Architecture & Engineering
4. Vulnerability, Change, & Configuration Management
5. Quality Assurance
6. Auditing - Processing, Systems, Applications
7. Development - Infrastructure / Web Applications

# Mission Statement
 
The ultimate expectation is to emulate the quality, format, and presentation of 
the [Syracuse University Cyber SEED Labs](http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/seed/Labs_16.04/) while 
creating strategic hubs of Cyber Security Center-of-Excellence Partnerships where the gap
between enterprise experience & academic learning is addressed by focusing training paths on 
people, products, and process. 

## SEED Funding / Training Programs
[AWS Educate](https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/) - Free cloud training for students w/ edu address <br/>
[AWS EdStart](https://aws.amazon.com/education/edstart/) - $500 in AWS Credits for startup's <br/>
[Program Solicitation NSF 17-573](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2017/nsf17573/nsf17573.htm) aims to make advancements in informal STEM learning. <br/>
[Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP)](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2019/nsf19590/nsf19590.htm) - SU's Master of Cyber Security program requires a bit more funding, this is opensource - win,win,win.<br/>  
[America's Seed Fund](https://seedfund.nsf.gov/) - a creative outlet
